# academic

Academic is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme with a focus on simplicity, typography and flexibility.
I originally designed it for my personal blog during my PhD thesis.

Check out my [personal website](https://gaalcaras.com) or my [blog](https://sociologs.com) to get a better feel for the Academic theme.

**Simplicity**: both in design and configuration, Academic aims to let the writer and its readers focus on the content.
Almost all of the theme configuration happens in the `_config.yml` file.

**Typography**: the goal of Academic is to let the author write very long and detailed posts, while being kind to its readers' eyes.

**Flexibility**: Academic can be used to generate different layouts while keeping the same look and feel.
All features require you to *opt in*, which means that you can either use a very lean `_config.yml` or a very detailed one if you want to use more features.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "academic"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: academic
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install academic
```

Then add the `jekyll-data` plugin to your `Gemfile` ([see also](https://github.com/ashmaroli/jekyll-data#installation)):

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-data'
end
```

I suggest you install and use `redcarpet` to generate your markdown ([read more](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#redcarpet)).

## Usage

### Change the brand color

Academic uses 4 shades of grey (very dark grey for the main content, ligther greys to lessen the emphasis on some elements) and a single "brand" color.

By default, the brand color is `#d33682` (purple). If it's not to your taste, you can easily change it by overriding the `$brand-color` variable in `/assets/styles.scss`.

```scss
$brand-color: red;
```

### Setup your `_config.yml` file

#### General settings

`title_html`: [optional] you can style the title of your website with html elements.

Example:

```html
title_html: "<b>hello</b>world"
```

`pitch`: [optional] a small sentence or motto to quickly describe your blog. If no pitch is detected, Academic will fill the top bar with a navigation menu. If you want to display a short pitch in the top bar, Academic will put thput the navigation menu in the footer. Please note that `pitch` is only used in the top bar ; it is different from the `description` field (used in the footer and the meta tags for search engines).

`description`: [recommended] short description for search engines. It's displayed in the footer of every page. Not to be confused with `pitch`.

`cc`: [optional] choose among the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses (v4). Accepted values are : `by`, `by-sa`, `by-nd`, `by-nc`, `by-nc-sa`, `by-nc-nd`. Defining the `cc` variable will add a small sentence in the footer. If no value is given, a small copyright is added instead.

`nb_posts_page`: [optional] number of posts to display on the homepage. By default, all posts are listed. Note that you should create a page with the archive layout.

`archive_permalink`: [optional] permalink of the archive page. Set to `"/archive"` by default.

`repo`: [optional] link to your website repo. If defined, it's added in the footer. Nothing is displayed otherwise.

`piwik`: [optional]

+ `url`: [mandatory] URL of your Piwik Instance without a trailing slash (like `mywebsite.com/piwik`)
+ `site_id`: [mandatory] The ID of your website in your Piwik instance

#### Author

`email`: [optional] add email address in about layout.

`curriculum`: [optional]

+ `name`: [optional] text of the link. Default : Curriculum Vitae.
+ `url`: [mandatory] url of the curriculum file.

`shortbio`: [optional] describe yourself in a sentence or two. If `shortbio` is defined, a small element is added at the end of the post to introduce the author to the readers.

`author_display`: [optional] if `true`, the author's name (and `author_website`) is added in the footer. `false` by default.

`author_website`: [optional] url to the external website of the author. If `author_website` exists, it is added in the about layout and in the footer (if `author_display` is `true`).

`twitter_username`: [optional] your Twitter username. If it exists, your account will be linked in the "call to action" boxes (homepage and posts), in the footer and on the about page.

`github_username`: [optional] your Github username. If it exists, your account will be linked in the footer and on the about page.

`keybase_username`: [optional] your Keybase username. If it exists, your account will be linked on the about page.

`linkedin_username`: [optional] your LinkedIn username. If it exists, your account will be linked on the about page.

#### Navigation menu

`nav_ext_links`: [optional] you can choose to add external links in the top bar. Each item has two attributes:

+ `name`: [mandatory] text for the link
+ `url`: [mandatory] url

Example:

```yaml
nav_ext_links:
  - name: Link 1
    url: http://jupiterbroadcasting.com/
  - name: Link 2
    url: http://wallabag.org/
```

#### Multilingual and i18n support

Academic works perfectly well as a single language website.
By default, Academic is in English.
You can easily switch to another supported language :

```yaml
langs: ["fr"]
```

If you need to translate part of your pages or posts, Academic also supports basic i18n and multilingual features.

To enable multilingual mode, just add the following to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
langs: ["fr", "en"]
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
    values:
      lang: "fr"
```

The `langs` variable should be an array containing your languages.
Important: the first item should be your "default" language (ie the language that you translate posts from or/and that has the largest content available).
The double quotes around the language *do* matter.

Don't forget to define a default lang for your whole website.

If you want to translate some of the variables in your `_config.yml`, you can just do this:

```yaml
title:
  fr: "Nom du site en Fran√ßais"
  en: "English name of the website"
```

Translating posts and pages is very easy.
Let's say my default lang is `fr` and I want to translate `_posts/billet-au-hasard.md` to English.

```yaml
---
layout: post
title:  "Billet au hasard"
permalink: /fr/billet-au-hasard/
date:   2017-02-14 15:32:29 +0100
---
```

First, I'll create a new file named `_posts/billet-au-hasard.en.md`.
Both files have to share the *exact same name before the first extension* (`.md` or `.en.md`) in order to signal to Academic that these posts are translations of eachother.

Then, in `_posts/billet-au-hasard.en.md`, add the lang and change the permalink in your frontmatter:

```yaml
layout: post
title: "Random post"
permalink: /en/random-post
date:   2017-02-14 15:32:29 +0100
lang: en
```

That's it!
Academic will handle the lang selector and will add `<link />` to the `<head>` section to improve SEO.

Note that you have to handle the permalinks manually.
I recommend that you use the subdirectory `/lang/` naming convention everywhere, as exemplified above.
You should at least take care of your homepage URL.

If you'd like Academic to support more languages, please contribute by adding the appropriate translations in `/_data/i18n_academic.yml`.

#### Plugins

Academic is compatible with the `jekyll-last-modified-at` plugin ([repo](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at)). If installed, the last modified date will be (discretely) displayed in the posts lists and in the post layout.

If you specified a Github `repo`, the last modified date will point to the revision history of the file.

### Layouts

#### Post layout

In the yaml header, you can add some tags to help Academic.

`summary`: [optional] a short text or abstract. Used in the posts lists and on the post page.

`thumbnail`: [optional] relative path to image or absolute url to an image that describes your post. Used in the posts lists and on the post page.

#### Page layout

In the yaml header, you can add some tags to help Academic.

`invisible`: [optional] if `true`, then this page will not be listed in the navigation menu.

#### About layout

Will automatically put the content of the page on the right column. The left column will automatically be filled with the author info provided in the `_config.yml`.

#### Archive layout

Create a `archive.md` page, choose the "archive" layout. You don't need to write anything in this file, all posts published will be listed in reverse chronological order.

#### 404 layout

Create a `404.md` page, set the layout:

```
layout: pagenotfound
```

The content of the page will be used in the 404¬†page.

#### Sitemap layout

Create a `sitemap.xml` page, set the layout:

```
layout: sitemap
```

You now have a sitemap you can feed to the search engines.

### Includes

Sometimes you need to use figures and images in your posts, with detailed captions and maybe even the source of the image.
The `image.html` allows you to do just that without all the HTML markup.

```
{% include image.html src="/assets/img/zotero-archives-numeriques/screencast.gif"
                      caption="Notre solution en action" 
                      desc="Screencast de capture Zotero"
                      source="Google"
                      href="http://google.com"%}
```
